# PowerShell Beginners Have to Start Somewhere

I wrote an [extensive walk-through](http://bit.ly/2OMqeXO) for this challenge.

The article covers the PowerShell topics:

+ Help system
+ Verb-noun naming convention
+ Command types
+ other basic concepts

Two alternate solutions by other challengers are also included.

It's a great article for the PowerShell novice to get up to speed while learning how to solve the challenge.
