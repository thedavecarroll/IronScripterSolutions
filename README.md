# My IronScripter Challenge Solutions

Welcome to the repo where I keep my solutions to as many of the IronScripter Challenges that I can complete.

## Let the PowerShell Challenges Begin

Iron Scripter grew out of the scripting games at PowerShell Summit.
The quote below comes from the [introductory post][IronScripter] on the Iron Scripter site.

> The Chairman has decided that it is in the best interests of his Iron Scripters,
> and those that wish to attain that valued designation, that training continue year-round.
> To that end, he has commissioned a series of PowerShell challenges.
> These challenges will range in complexity and be tagged accordingly.
